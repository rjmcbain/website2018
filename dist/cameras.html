    <p>
      Below are a few cameras that i'd recommend. They vary in specs and prices. They are also all on sale right now on
      B&H and Amazon. (So dont wait too long)
    </p>
    <p>Each camera is built differently and performs differently in certain situations.
      Cameras are built with different sensors. Sony uses a mirrorless system and nikons and canons use a mirror
      (DSLR).
      Mirrorless is often faster, performs better in low light (night photography) and are also lighter then DSLRs
      (good
      for traveling). The
      body size of a mirrorless can also be up to half the size and weight of a DSLR.
      Mirrorless cameras are the new technology and DSLRs are the old tech. Since mirrorless is new there aren't as
      many options for lenses. Nikon and Canon have a ton of lenses and can be much cheaper. Also the battery life
      sucks for mirrorless cameras. You can always buy more batteries, that's what i do.

    </p>
    <p>The sensors also vary in size. There are crop sensors and full frame sensors. Crop sensors are cheaper but full
      frame often produces a cleaner, higher megapixel photo. But technology has come a long way and the average person
      cant tell the difference.
      Since the crop sensor is smaller, the image is magnified by 1.5 times. So a 20mm lens on a crop sensor is
      actually 30mm but a 20mm lens on a full frame is just 20mm. If that is confusing, don't worry, it's not that
      important at first BUT one thing to remember is that a crop sensor camera can use both crop sensor and full
      frame lenses and
      full frames can only use full frame lenses. So with a crop sensor you have more options for lenses and crop
      lenses are cheaper then full frame.</p>
    <p>The auto focusing varies big time between cameras. Sony (mirrorless) seems to have the fastest AF.
      Fast AF is great for action photos like wildlife and sports. The more AF points the faster is will focus on the
      subject. <br>
      FPS (Frames per second) is the amount of pictures you'll capture (providing the lighting is just about perfect)
      per second.
      a 10 FPS will take 10 photos a second and some can take over 200 photos within 20 seconds. This is also great for
      action shots like wildlife and sports.
      If you're planning on taking a lot photos from a tripod or no action shots then this probably isn't important.
    </p>
    <p>Sony makes very impressive cameras. They are great in low light and fast for sports and wildlife. Another thing
      that is very impressive is
      the in body stabilaztion. This means the sensor has a 5-axis image stabilaztion so if your shutter is too slow or
      you move the camera while taking a photo
      it will comensate for the movement. That way your photos wont come out blurry. Also, you don't need to buy lenses
      with Image stabilaztion built in, making the lenses cheaper.
      Nikon and Canons lenses have stabilaztion built into most of their lenses but not their bodies. But once again,
      sony doesn't offer
      many lenses and the ones they do are expensive.
      You'd have to shop third party lenses like Sigma or Tamron. They both make good lenses but can be heavy.
    </p>
    <p>Megapixels aren't as important as they used to be. Most cameras now have between 20MP-26MP. The higher end
      professional cameras
      have between 36-45MP but they cost $4,000 just for the body. Megapixels are great if you want to make poster
      sized prints of your
      photos for art gallerys. The 20MP are just fine for social media and they can be printed large. But the larger
      the print and the
      smaller the MP the more noise you'll see in your photos.
    </p>
    <p>These are all great mid level/beginner cameras. You can go cheaper and still get great results but the
      cheaper the camera the better the lighting you'll need. Cheaper cameras struggle in low light. I started with a
      Nikon D5300 and
      within a year a upgraded to a mid level camera. I was able to get great results with it but the dynamic range was
      half of my new camera
      and it struggled a lot in low light, which i what i look at most. Everyone is different.</p>
    <p>
      The first three cameras below are what i would be looking at in that price range. I've been shooting nikon for
      awhile
      now. My friend owns the Nikon D7500 and loves it. It is a great camera. I have 2 friends who shoot with the Sony
      A6000
      series and both take excellent photos. I've never really liked canon. They do make great cameras but seem to be a
      few
      steps behind Nikon and Sony when releasing new cameras BUT that Canon 6D Mark II is full frame and it is newer.
      It's
      also on sale and you probably wont see it at that price again until next winter. I hope this helps.
